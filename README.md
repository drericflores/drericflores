👋 **Hi, I’m Dr. Eric Flores!**  
- 👀 I have a passion for programming as a hobby, with a special focus on the integration and usability of the Linux Operating System.  
- 🌱 Currently, I’m deepening my skills in Python by converting small projects from C and C++ into Python. This hands-on approach helps me learn through comparison.  
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating with other programmers to modernize *GFABASIC* as a fun side project. The goal is to create a modern version of BASIC with updated constructs that can run seamlessly on Linux.  
- 📫 Feel free to reach out via email at [eoftoro@gmail.com](mailto:eoftoro@gmail.com). Please mention that you’re contacting me about this project or any other GitHub project I’ve shared.
