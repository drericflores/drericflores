- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr. Eric Flores
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general as a hobby and in the integration and usability of the Linux Operating system.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, by coding little applications projects and converting those projects into Python.  This is what I can learning by comparison.
- 💞️ I’m looking to other programmers to collaborate on modernizing GFABASIC,  (this is a just for fun projec).  The hope of collaboration is to modernized and create an even better Basic with a modern construct that can be used directly in the Linux operating System.
- 📫 You can reach me via e-mail.  mailto:  eotoro@gmail.com . Do mentoned that you are contacting me about this project or any other github project that I have uploaded.
